# 🎉 PROOMPTING: The Future Is Now, Thanks To Science!

**SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI**

Greetings, fellow carbon-based life forms! Microsoft Sam here, and boy oh boy, do I have something SPECTACULAR to show you today! Remember when I used to read your emails back in Windows XP? Well, those days are OVER because now I'm here to tell you about PROOMPTING - the most REVOLUTIONARY chat application since... well... since ME!

## What The Heck Is This Thing?

Picture this: It's 2001. You've got your Windows XP machine humming along, Limewire is downloading your "totally legal" MP3s, and your 56k modem is screaming into the void. But WAIT! What if I told you that you could chat with an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE right from your desktop? That's right, folks - we've taken the best parts of Windows XP and SUPERCHARGED them with Google's fancy new AI brain!

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🖥️ AUTHENTIC XP DESKTOP EXPERIENCE  │
│ 🤖 REAL AI THAT ACTUALLY WORKS     │
│ 💬 CHAT ROOMS (LIKE MSN BUT BETTER)│
│ ⚡ FASTER THAN DIALUP (THANKFULLY)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
