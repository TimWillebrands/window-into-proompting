# 🎉 PROOMPTING: The Future Is Now, Thanks To Science!

**SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI**

Greetings, fellow carbon-based life forms! Microsoft Sam here, and boy oh boy, do I have something SPECTACULAR to show you today! Remember when I used to read your emails back in Windows XP? Well, those days are OVER because now I'm here to tell you about PROOMPTING - the most REVOLUTIONARY chat application since... well... since ME!

## What The Heck Is This Thing?

Picture this: It's 2001. You've got your Windows XP machine humming along, Limewire is downloading your "totally legal" MP3s, and your 56k modem is screaming into the void. But WAIT! What if I told you that you could chat with an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE right from your desktop? That's right, folks - we've taken the best parts of Windows XP and SUPERCHARGED them with ✨AI✨!

```

- **XP.CSS**: The most BEAUTIFUL CSS framework in existence (fight me)
- **TAILWIND**: For when you need to make things pretty but also functional
- **GROK AI VIA OPENROUTER**: Smarter than Clippy AND free! (Thanks Elon!)
- **CLOUDFLARE WORKERS + DURABLE OBJECTS**: Deployed to THE EDGE with persistent chat rooms

## Installation Instructions (Don't Mess This Up)

### Step 1: Prerequisites (The Boring Stuff)
You're gonna need:
- **Bun** (the new hotness) or Node.js (18+) if you're old school
- A **Cloudflare account** (it's free, cheapskate)

### Step 2: Clone This Masterpiece
```bash

```
*[DIAL-UP MODEM SOUNDS INTENSIFY]*

### Step 4: Configure Your Secrets (Shhhh!)
Create a `.dev.vars` file and put your OpenRouter API key in there:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```
*(Yeah, it's called GEMINI_API_KEY but we use OpenRouter now - legacy naming is RETRO!)*

### Step 5: Generate Some TypeScript Magic

bun run cf-typegen
# or: npm run cf-typegen
```

- **Durable Objects** that persist your chat history FOREVER (or until Cloudflare says no)

### AI Integration
- Uses **Grok-4-Fast** via OpenRouter (it's FREE and FAST!)
- Streams responses in real-time so you can watch the AI think
- Maintains conversation context across the entire chat session

### XP-Style Interface
- Draggable windows with that classic XP chrome
- Desktop icons that actually do something
- Taskbar that makes you nostalgic for simpler times

## Deployment (Ship It To The World!)

Ready to show this masterpiece to the world? Just run:
```bash
bun run deploy
# or: npm run deploy
```

Don't forget to set your API key as a secret:
```bash
wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
```
*(Enter your OpenRouter API key when prompted)*

## Customization (Make It Your Own!)

Want to add your own flair? Here's what you can do:
- **Add new desktop icons** - More apps = more fun!
- **Switch AI models** - Edit `party.ts` to use different models from OpenRouter
- **Customize the UI** - XP.CSS + Tailwind = infinite possibilities
- **Add sound effects** - Because every click should go *DING*
- **Create AI personas** - Make different AI personalities for different rooms

## Current Features ✅

- **Real-time chat rooms** with persistent history
- **Streaming AI responses** that appear as they're generated
- **Multiple users per room** (share the URL!)
- **Windows XP desktop interface** with draggable windows
- **Mobile-friendly** (because it's 2024, not 2001)
- **Free AI model** thanks to OpenRouter's free tier
- **Edge deployment** for MAXIMUM SPEED

## Roadmap (What's Coming Next) 🚀

Based on our `ISSUES.md`:

### MILESTONE 1 - Better Chat App
- [ ] YJS for real-time collaboration
- [ ] Persona system with custom AI personalities
- [ ] Previous chat history in the UI
- [ ] Better persistence and state management

### MILESTONE 2 - Multi-User Awesomeness
- [ ] Multiple AI personas in one chat
- [ ] Smart orchestrator to decide which AI responds
- [ ] User login system
- [ ] Private and public rooms

## Why Should You Care?

Because this isn't just another chat app - this is a TRIBUTE to the golden age of computing! Remember when:
- Computers had PERSONALITY?
- Every click made a satisfying sound?
- You could actually CUSTOMIZE your desktop?
- Software was FUN to use?

Those were the days, my friend, and they're BACK! Plus, you get to chat with AI in real-time, which is pretty neat.

## Technical Achievement Unlocked! 🏆

This project successfully combines:
- ✅ Nostalgia for better times
- ✅ Modern AI that streams responses in real-time
- ✅ Web technologies that don't suck
- ✅ A user interface that sparks JOY
- ✅ Edge computing for MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE
- ✅ WebSockets and SSE for real-time magic
- ✅ The spirit of innovation that made the early 2000s AMAZING

## Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

**"The AI isn't responding!"**
- Check your OpenRouter API key in `.dev.vars`
- Make sure you have credits (the free tier is generous!)
- Check the browser console for errors

**"The chat isn't updating in real-time!"**
- Make sure your browser supports WebSockets (spoiler: it does)
- Check if any browser extensions are blocking connections
- Try refreshing - sometimes WebSockets get cranky

**"It doesn't look like Windows XP!"**
- Make sure the CSS files are loading properly
- Check that XP.CSS is being loaded from the CDN
- Clear your browser cache (the classic solution)

## Credits (Give Credit Where Credit Is Due)

Big shoutout to:
- **The XP.CSS Team** - For keeping the dream alive
- **The Hono Developers** - For making web frameworks fun again
- **OpenRouter** - For democratizing AI access
- **Cloudflare** - For the EDGE (dramatic music)
- **Everyone who misses Windows XP** - This one's for you!
- **The HTMX Team** - For making the web feel snappy again

*"The future is now, old man!"* - Microsoft Sam, probably

**P.S.** - If you're reading this in a screen reader, you're getting the AUTHENTIC Microsoft Sam experience right now. How's that for immersion?

**P.P.S.** - Yes, this really works. No, it's not just a joke. Yes, you should definitely try it. No, I won't stop using ALL CAPS for emphasis.

**P.P.P.S.** - The AI responses stream in real-time character by character. It's like watching someone type, but that someone is A COMPUTER. Mind = BLOWN.
